uConsole to Flipper Zero module adapter PCB files. 

This is the first PCB I have designed in 20 years.

Recently I purchased the uConsole and thought, Wouldnt it be nice to have GPS, CC1101, NRF as modules rather than trying to manually install these. So here we are.

Rev 0.1 board doesnt have a revision number on the board and was the intial design I got made by PCBway. I made and ordered these before I had the uConsole in my hands. The boards I ordered were too thick so it allowed a second revision to be made to fix a few things.
Rev 0.1 only has basic parts. no speaker pads included.

Rev 0.2 will have the speaker pads. The USB holes will be relocated and the Flipper Zero plug will be flipped as I feel its upside down on Rev 0.2
